Could do a taylor expansion 

## Most comonly used method

```
RESP : Restricted electrostatic potential
Use FF  program maybe gammes 
Even if quantum used

### Looking at molecules

```
We want transferable properties 
* Force defined as derivative of the averaging

Need to understand rough critcal view in order to use programs

### Bond stretching 

Hookes law i.e spring
cases where we elongate bond ie H bond in water

## Angle Bending
Relationship between atom 1 and 3 

## Bond Twisting 

Affected by many factors, so many atoms
torsion angles  

May take from IR but fails the complexity of enviroment 

Intrinsically disordered protiens, helices always came out original bias from cristalography
strongly enviroment dependent. Try to improve angle may make a bifg diffrence in our simulations

Prolinine lecture 2, has out of plane movment

Important regulation of transcription, nature cares about this 
Effects that we don't realize intuitatively. 

Vand der Walls assumed weak not always ie high ionic strength the becomme more dominant

## Protein Contact maps

surface of a protein and a transcription factor
When they bind the interaction landscape $ij$ changes 
even for free energy is very shallow 
The point is we don't end up with one structure
Multiple structures
How they can be specific?
Almost all your gene expression is on this 

Some contacts exist in 2 structure some exist in 8
frustration tells you how optimal the contact is 
Not all contacts can be fulfilled well at same time  
some energetically okay some energetically dead

In our case group.. 
$\sim$ 100 of these  

we can look at them in free-form, and bound form 
try to make a simple ML algorithm 

Input data 
some kind of coarse grained energetics 

Its an ensemble of frustration (dB) of frustration

parameters for fitting
contacts

say we have 20x20 
what percentage of the time does each contact exist?
get something like the stability of the contact
try and fit the set of frustration basis? 13.37 

Maybe Monika already has something computed don't need to get secondary from Angelica 
We don't need to represent 

get frustration indices maybe one for whole structure
have the ensamble, take our estimate
MDtraj  reccoended on moodle
we can see how fast we can compute the matrix 
see how fast we can say there is this contact in 10% of the structures
5:43: Our project start part 
Group: Jake, Melika, Angelica 

PDB ensembles
Monika has a lot of these things as she is interested in the specificities are determined

Look at the energies of the contacts 
Descriptor is a frustration index

Let's say this is a surface of a protein and this is something like a transcription factor And when they bind this landscape now for the interaction, so I J and even I must say,I mean, for the three energy, okay, very shallow
So the point is that you don't endup in one structure, but you end uphaving multiple structure in, and then they bound
And the enigmatic points of the scientific question here is how they can be specific. Almost all your gene expression is on this
